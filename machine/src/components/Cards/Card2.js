    Wheel tractor-scrapers are also used in earthmoving operations. This piece of heavy equipment consists of a rear hopper which can move vertically, with a sharp edge for flattening a surface. The front end hosts a sharp edge to cut soil and a carpenterâ€™s plane for cutting wood. The two tools work together to fill the hopper and transport whatever material was removed from a cleared area.
